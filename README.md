# Self-RAG: Self-supervised Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Overview
Self-RAG (Self-supervised Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances the performance of RAG models by integrating self-supervised learning techniques. This approach refines both the retrieval and generation components of RAG systems, allowing them to learn from unlabeled data and improve their contextual relevance.

## Features
- **Self-supervised learning**: Improves retrieval and generation without requiring labeled data.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Leverages external knowledge sources for more accurate responses.

## Installation
To install dependencies and set up the environment, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
